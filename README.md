# IcarusFlow

IcarusFlow is a minimalist productivity web application based on the **Flowtime Technique**, designed with a clean and modern UI inspired by Pomofocus.

## 🚀 Features

- **Flowtime Logic**: Unlike traditional Pomodoro, IcarusFlow uses a progressive timer (counting up) during focus sessions.
- **Smart Break Calculation**: When you stop a focus session, the app automatically calculates a break time equal to **20%** of your focused time.
- **Dynamic Themes**: The interface switches between a smooth Red (#BA4949) for Focus and a calm Teal (#38858A) for Breaks.
- **Tab Integration**: 
  - Real-time time display in the browser tab title.
  - Custom white minimalist favicon.
- **Audio Notifications**: An alarm sounds when your break session ends.
- **Modern UI**: Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React icons, featuring glassmorphism effects and responsive design.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React 19** (Vite)

- **Lucide React** (Icons)
